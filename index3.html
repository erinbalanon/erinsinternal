                <p>Auditory learners may appear to be less attentive in the classroom since they prefer to absorb information while the teacher speaks 
                rather than taking notes. For some students, writing is a distraction from fully immersing themselves in a lecture, yet for others, writing 
                is one of the most effective forms of reinforcement. These students are also more talkative than their peers and may ask more 
                questions during lectures to reinforce learning through hearing instances. Patience is a virtue that these students must have.</p>

                <p>In class, auditory learners tend to listen, talk, memorise, and debate. They prefer audiobooks to print books for learning.</p>
