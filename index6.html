            <p>Identifying your best learning style, whether visual, aural, reading/writing, or kinesthetic, and aligning your overall course of study with 
            these learning styles, will positively impact your education. Take note that a combination of the four learning styles may be the best 
            option for you. Allowing yourself to access information in terms that are familiar to you will boost your academic confidence and 
            performance in school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The reason why this website was created was to help students enhance their performance in school and to learn about what learning 
            style best fits them for a better study experience. This website contains information on the different learning styles, a quiz for students 
            to take and material to aid them in enhancing their learning and study methods based on their prefered learning style.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In summary, by understanding what kind of learner you are, you can now gain a better perspective on how to implement these learning 
            styles into your lessons and study techniques.</p>
