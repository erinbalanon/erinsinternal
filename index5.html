                <p>You may be aware that kinesthetic learners are hands-on learners who need to walk through a process to fully comprehend its dynamics. Kinesthetic 
                learners are uncommon; according to studies, just 5% of students learn best through direct hands-on experiences. Kinesthetic learners are often referred 
                to as tactile learners. There is, however, a distinction to be made between the two. The kinesthetic learner isn't limited to learning through 
                touch; instead, they use sensory input from all five senses to better understand what they're doing. Kinesthetic learners learn life skills more rapidly 
                than others, such as cooking, which allows for a scenario in which all five senses are involved.</p>

                <br>
                <p>These students enjoy doing hands-on projects like taking things apart and reassembling them, playing with Legos, or completing a puzzle. 
                Kinesthetic learners find it more difficult to adjust to a traditional classroom environment.</p>
