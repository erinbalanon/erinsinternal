                <p>Students who excel at traditional study methods are often read/write learners. They're the type of students who don't mind sitting down 
                and reading a textbook in order to learn something new. Learners who can read and write do well in lectures because they prefer to 
                take careful notes on what the teacher says. Their note-taking is a strength of theirs because it enhances their learning and later serves 
                as a useful study aid.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Read/write learners are often independent, but they can expand their intellectual horizons by being exposed to new study and job 
                methods that are outside of their comfort zone. Many students are unaware of their learning style, therefore the teacher's responsibility 
                in their lives is to help them discover it and build on their strengths.</p>
