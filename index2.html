                <p>Visual learners, also known as visual spatial learners, account for about 65 percent of the population. However, according to a 2001 
                study by Specific Diagnostic Studies, only about 29% of primary and secondary school students fall into this category. This number is 
                likely to have increased in the last 15 years due to the impact of smartphones and tablets on how children learn. Preferred learning 
                styles may evolve in response to environmental inputs and over time as our brains expand and mature, according to one study.

                <p>Students who prefer to communicate concepts and thoughts through visuals, graphics, colours, and maps are said to have a visual 
                    learning style. Visual learners must see something in order to learn it. These students are more likely to recall information utilising 
                    colour, tone, and brightness because they have a photographic memory. Diagrams made on a whiteboard or in class presentations will 
                    be beneficial to visual learners.
